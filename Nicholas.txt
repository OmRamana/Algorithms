Okay. Just so you know there is not much to it.
 I'm just trying to generate chest x-rays that
 would be good enough to to use as training data
 for a classification model. This data is only
 being used to train the discriminator network. 
You can use any subset of the data. To start, I 
choose to work with all of the data labeled "AP"
 (anterior-posterior). My guess is that you may 
need to make minor changes to architecture or
 modify the hyperparameters
